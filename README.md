Abandonment got to this one too.

Should've been a public transport navigation app, got busy rewriting route searching from brute-force recursion to smarty stops selection.

Can be used as weak example of two-layerd recursively directed (probably? I'm no good with terms) graph for lowest cost route search (A->B->A(->B->A)), though I think I've never finished smart search algo.

Also can be slightly more productively used as MobX References use (probably old by now)

Have fun digging through recursive mess I've left here.
